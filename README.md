# Version control practice Wednesday

A temporary repository for practice during the workshop today.

There are three files you can edit and create pull requests for, but you can also add new content to the repository.

This repository is **public**, so anyone can see it, not just the participants in the workshop today.

This repository will be made private and then deleted from GitHub at the end of the workshop. However, because Git is distributed then each of your clones of the repository will exist until you delete it. Deleting this repository will remove any issues and pull request comments.


Git-Hub - why oh why...
